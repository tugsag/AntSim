# AntSim
Simulation of an ant colony

Utilizes different data structures (Arrays, Lists, Maps) and aims to use efficient algorithms. 

Pressing 'run' will initiate a fast simulation and pressing 'step' will move the simulation one turn at a time. 
Different ant types are represented by different colored icons on the colony grid. These can be found in the images folder.
